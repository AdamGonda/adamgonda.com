  about:
    It's a really cool company that specializes in all things engineering and technology.
    They were founded way back in <b>1994</b> and have been killing it ever since. They work with a ton of
    different industries, like energy and manufacturing, and are always coming up with innovative solutions.
  hireStory:
    They approached me with a job opportunity on <b>LinkedIn</b> which led to a really long and challenging technical
    interview, and then an offer to join this excellent project where I do some micro-frontend magic + react.
  jobDescription:
    I am really proud of the fact that I was quickly promoted to be the project's senior lead.
    It was cool but steep, because I had to quickly become the "senior" with a lot of
    new responsibilities. Tech wise a few key decisions were already made. Mainly around the stack, like it
    was a given that we go with <b>Piral</b> and <b>React</b> but other than that a lot was left to me like coming up
    with the project's whole <b>frontend architecture</b>. On the managerial side I got the challenging
    task to retrain and lead a bunch of seasoned <b>C#</b> backend devs to work on the frontend.
