      <h1>Blog</h1>
      <p>
        I always wanted to create a blog and now I actually can do it so I thought it would be nice to try it.

        This stuff will be about whatever interests me or catches my attention, mostly about software development
        but maybe there will be a few other topics here and there. I try to add new posts regularly like every week.
