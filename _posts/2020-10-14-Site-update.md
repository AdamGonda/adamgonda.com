Fixed a few issues, and redesigned some things. I think this blog is going in the right direction,
but I always like to listen for valuable feedback.

# Bug fixes

I noted a few issues, both were on the index page, where you can scroll through the blog posts. Both related to the list items that represent a post.

{% include post-image.html
  title='Problem 1'
  src='tag-fix.svg'
  date=page.date
%}

As you can see, if it was too many tags related to a blog post, it messed up the whole layout of the page on small screen sizes.

  date=page.date
