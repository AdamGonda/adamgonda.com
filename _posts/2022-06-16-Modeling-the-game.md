I will start by modelling the game, then
we will setup our dev env.

This post is part of a [series](/2022/06/13/Snake-Ã -la-functional.html){:target='_blank'} on recreating `Snake`
in a functional style using `JavaScript` and a package I wrote.

# Refresher

I assume you know this game, but let's go through it.
We have a snake in a constrained environment, where
the goal is to eat the most amount of food and grow without
colliding with the walls or with our own tail.

# State

I model the game in a 2D coordinate system, where
every `game object` will have an `x` and `y` position.
The `initial state` is a great place to define our game state.

```js

```

  src='snake-in-2d-grid.jpg'
  date=page.date
%}

As I said we will use [loop](https://github.com/AdamGonda/loop){:target='_blank'}
for our game loop. So let's start with creating the dev setup.

Create a folder and run npm init:

```md
mkdir snake-game && cd snake-game && npm init -y
```

Install [loop](https://github.com/AdamGonda/loop){:target='_blank'}:

```md
npm install adamgonda/loop
```

Create an `index.js`, and with that you will have the basic setup:

```js
const { run } = require('loop')
const { pipe } = require('loop/utils')

const initialState = { player: { x: 10, y: 5, isHappy: true }}
const renderMap = { player: 'X' }
const dimensions = { width: 20, height: 10 }

function update(state, input) {
  return pipe(state)(state => state)
}

function toCommon(state) {
  return [{ ...state.player, tag: 'player' }]
}

run({
  initialState,
  update,
  toCommon,
  renderMap,
  dimensions,
})
```
