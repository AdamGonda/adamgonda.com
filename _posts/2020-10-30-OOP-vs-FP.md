I like to clarify why I think Functional Programming practices are
preferable most of the time, when it comes to usual business applications.

# Being reasonable

I think OOP has it's placed, as we all know in software development there are no absolutes,
I think by time, you have to come to a conclusion as you acquire more and more experience,
that you have to join "those" guys, who are if asked, they always say "it depends".
