Tinkering with JavaScript during development to try out ideas is very valuable. Before the only way that I knew was to open dev tools in the browser. Although it works it’s not that convenient when you like to work out something. For that, I found the perfect solution.

{% include post-content-list.html titles=page.titles %}

# The answer

[Quokka js](https://quokkajs.com/){:target='_blank'} 👇

> The javascript playground in your editor

When you have to find out if your function works as you thought you can just open a new file in your editor and find it out.

# Install and usage

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target='_blank'} like many others.
So if you use it too then you just need to get the [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode){:target='_blank'}.

If installed, open the `Command Palette` and type 👇

{% include post-image.html
  src='1.jpg'
  date=page.date
%}

then select if you like to create an empty `JavaScript` or `TypeScript` file, or choose from the other options.

{% include post-image.html
  src='2.jpg'
  date=page.date
%}

`voilà` now you can iron out that bad boy. ✌🏼
