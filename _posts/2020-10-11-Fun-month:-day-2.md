I am a Functional Programming fanboy, and I thought I will create a small game in the terminal,
then it turned out to be a perfect RPC API also.

# First steps 

I like to create games, and I
liked to practice my [FP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming){:target="_blank"}
skills
so I took my favorite game to implement [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)){:target="_blank"} and implemented it using
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript){:target="_blank"} in a functional manner.

When it was done I started to think about the [stateless](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application_development/9781788831437/1/ch01lvl1sec16/stateless-versus-stateful){:target="_blank"}
nature of FP and the beauty of this implementation. The business logic is nicely separated from everything
else, and the whole thing is a pure function. This implementation used [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/){:target="_blank"} and I rendered the game to the [console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_console){:target="_blank"}.
So at this point I had a simple Snake game in the terminal.

# Spice it up

The presentation and the game logic already was two different things.
The API between the two was very clear, so I started to think... 

One option is to ship the logic to the frontend, but it's too obvious
and this is my fun little project. So I though that it would be
interesting if this code stays at the backend.
The API is already very clear and my implementation is totally stateless
and separate from the presentation ðŸ¤ .

So I took the game logic and I created a Node app and I decided to host it on
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/){:target="_blank"}.

# Solution

<br>
**Frontend**:
I called my old friend [p5.js](https://p5js.org){:target="_blank"}
to the rescue for the rendering. With the clean separation, this
module's job is very straightforward. It's initializes the state, then
it calls the Node server on every iteration of the game to get the new state to render.

**Backend**:
Node server running on Heroku, totally stateless and it knows nothing about the rendering.
It is just a mapping between:
``` js
(currentState, input) => newState
```
<br>

Of course this is not an optimal solution, But I thought it maybe can
useful for learning proposes for other if they like to implement the rendering part,
<br>for concepts like:

- [Network latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)){:target="_blank"}
- [Concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)){:target="_blank"}
- [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns){:target="_blank"}

<br>

So you can learn about them first hand without the need to implement
any business logic, and with games involved ðŸ˜€, which always makes
things more fun I think.

# API
<br>
``` js
async function testAPI() {
  const ROOT_URL = 'https://retro-game-api-snake.herokuapp.com'

  // Possible inputs
  const DIRS = {
    UP: 'UP',
    DOWN: 'DOWN',
    RIGHT: 'RIGHT',
    LEFT: 'LEFT',
  }

  // Init
  const currentState = await fetch(`${ROOT_URL}/init`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => data)

  console.log('Init state: ', currentState)

  // Update
  fetch(`${ROOT_URL}/update`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Accept': 'application/json',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ state: currentState, input: DIRS.UP }),
  })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => console.log('New state: ', data))
}

testAPI()
```
