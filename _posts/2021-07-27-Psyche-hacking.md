Mind control, visualization, positive thinking, meditation, mindfulness.
Overused terms, some mainstream some already corny.
But are they bullshit?
Or we just became lazy and bought the easily purchaseable happiness lie?

# Needle on the track

There are useful facts about how our mind works. Like that we think in stories,
we stuck in this wierd word of the constant unfolding of time. We are like a needle on the track.
We ride this wave of mix of sensory inputs and random thoughts which are steer our attention.

If you ever tried meditation than you are familiar with the phenomena.
You are sitting in silence and examining your thoughts, as they come and go.
I wondered where thoughts come from, what is the mechanism, and the lowest
where I could go to witness how they formed.
I find that it's seems to be a back box that spits these things out.
First I thought that this mechanism is random, but than I had to realize that I was wrong.

# Modulate your black box

So when you realize that your mind is "programmable" which means you can tell it what kind of
thoughts you would it to spit out randomly, you have to realise a few other things as well,
or at least I did when I encountered this idea.

My first fear was that I will "create" these wrong thoughts
and cripple my life with the misusing of this powerful tool.

These thoughts come up way faster than you think and they play a crucial role
of how we interpret the world.
So it's important that we provide a good black box that will react positively,
creates good thoughts and eventually a good world.

# Problems

So I mentioned that you can control your life with this low level psyche hacking tool.
So the point is that this is a very simple system in regard of abstraction.
They kind a before speech, so you need to use simple terms, and messages that
need no conscious interpretation. Negation is non negotiable.

Negation has too much logic in it, it doesn't compute.
So need to avoid mantras and messages like: "I won't fail" and stuff like that.
The other thing is that you would like to define your present state,
so it's best to use present tense, this gives the best results.

But the most important for me was to be able to think good.
I was filled with fear. Where you stuck
in this vicious loop, when you fear that you will think bad stuff
and you are fucked.

# The difference between good and evil

I felt poisoned with fear. But than I realized that
I know the difference between good and evil which become my cornerstone.
With this fact at the bottom I was able to grow on it, this great tree of good possibilities.
I feel that you can't live a good life without knowing the difference between good and evil.

I think you have to have it in yourself, this golden seed of goodness at least.
I would say despite of the suffering, but I think suffering is necessary.
Without it you would not move forward, and without moving, you won't reach your goal.

# Balancing act

If you are add time to the 2 dimensional balancing act than you get a straight line.
This is the path you follow to get to the goal. The fastest route is a straight line.
Why time is important? Because you will die. But this fear of dieing isn't useful.
Because these goals are just illusion.

> If this all is an illusion, then tools are illusions as well, and goals also.

They say not the goal but the journey is the point. Just think about it
isn't this crazy game we playing would be the best way to find ourselves?  

# Be the good in the world
