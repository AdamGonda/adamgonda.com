The goal of this post is to introduce you to the `console-runner` package.
Show it's API through a toy example and tell a bit more about its inner workings.

> **Note:**
this is part of a **"FP Snake"** series on creating a Snake game in FP style
using JavaScript, where we learning Functional Programming concepts
while we recreating this classing game.

# Intro

If you ever created a game before,
you know that in the ‚ù§Ô∏è of every game, there is a
game loop and its job is to keep updating the game until we exit.
In the case of Snake, the `console-runner` will provide our game loop.
Here is a high-level overview of our architecture.

{% include post-image.html

%}

As you can see we have two main parts, one is the `console-runner`
where most of the `I/O` happens, and another is the game where we
will implement our game logic, with a clear `API` between the two.

It is a nice practice to separate the presentation
from the business logic. This approach simplifies
our application and sets clear boundaries.
So when we implement the game, our only job will be
to deal with the game-specific issues.

We will lay down the basis of our setup now but
we won't get into the game part just jet, first I like you to
familiarize yourself with the `console-runner`.

# Setup

<p>Create a folder and open it with VS Code:</p>{: .pre-code}
```js
mkdir snake-game && cd snake-game && code .
```

<p>Create a package.json file:</p>{: .pre-code}
```js
npm init -y
```

<p>Create a runSnake.js file:</p>{: .pre-code}
```js
touch runSnake.js
```

<p>Install the console-runner package:</p>{: .pre-code}
```js
npm i adamgonda/console-runner
```

# Example

```js
// runSnake.js

const { run } = require('console-runner')

run({
  initialState: {
    player: {
      x: 10,
      y: 5,
    },
  },
  toCommon: state => [
    {
      ...state.player,
      tag: 'player',
    },
  ],
  update: (state, input) => state,
  renderMap: {
    player: 'X',
  },
  dimensions: {
    width: 20,
    height: 10,
  },
})
```

<p>Then run it with Node.</p>{: .pre-code}
```js
node runSnake.js
```

<p>
If you did everything right, you have to see something like this.
Try to play around with it. For example, see what happens
if you press AWSD or mess with the <code>update</code> function. Familiarize
yourself with this package and it's API because we will use this during the course.
</p>{: .pre-code}
```js
{ player: { x: 10, y: 5 } }
input null

|          X          |

# API

{% include api-signature.html
  name="initialState"
  type="object"
%}

It will be the starting point of our game,
here we provide a state that we like to have at the
beginning.

{% include api-signature.html
  name="toCommon"
  type="function"
%}

It is specific to a given game,
its job is to transform the game state into a common format,
which is a list of objects, that has
an `x`, `y`, and a `tag` property.


{% include api-signature.html
  name="update"
  type="function"
%}

It encapsulates our game logic,
and it is called before every render.

{% include api-signature.html
  name="renderMap"
  type="object"
%}

Here you can specify a mapping between tags
to ASCII characters.

{% include api-signature.html
  name="dimensions"
  type="object"
%}

Tells how big a view you like to create.

# Last touch

<p>We will add a <code>start</code> script to <code>package.json</code> file so when we
start to develop the game, it will be more convenient to start it.</p>{: .pre-code}
```js
"scripts": {
  "start": "node runSnake.js"
}
```

# Next steps

You did great ü•≥ and reached the end of this section.
[Next](#){:target='_blank'} we will start to check out the
different features we have to implement regarding the game.
