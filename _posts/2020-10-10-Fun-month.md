I didn't felt great lately, I watched too much YouTube, movies, series. Listened to too many podcasts,
eat too much. So I thought something has to change.

# Reassess

If you feel shitty watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTMDpizis8){:target='_blank'}
from Jacko Wilkins, then start to think ðŸ˜€.

# Solution

First I tried to find the reasons why I feel shitty. Then Jordan Peterson came to my mind, and the things
he sad, when he talked about creative people. More precisely that you are like a fruit-bearing tree,
you can suppress your true nature about the fact that you have to have created stuff but you probably will feel terrible.

And yes I think I am a creative person ðŸ¤ , I decided to try to create more, so I started this challenge.
I have to create something every day, for a month, starting today. It doesn't matter what it is, the point
is that it has to be some kind of artifact that I can show here. A piece of code, drawing, music, blog post, anything...
