All fired up, excited, interesting ideas flood your mind, you break open your laptop and start typing,
but by then you already made the <b>no.1</b> mistake. Do you wanna know why?

# The problem

I <b>f***ed</b> this up so many times, I feel confident and I jump in on
a task and start hammering out code, it works, it's tidy, it's smart, it does the job.
Then sometime later I realize, I solved the wrong problem ðŸ˜†

# Thinking before coding

Among other things, it can prevent you from contextualizing or modeling the problem wrong,
because usually, my problem is that I think I know the problem so I can start working out
the solution, but when it comes to more complex problems, it could be that you classify
the problem wrong and start solving it needlessly.

# Pen and paper

Try spending <b>15 minutes</b> with a <b>pen and paper before</b> you start coding, so maybe you can avoid
the painful realization after -hopefully just a day but some unfortunate times a week- of coding
that you don't know what you're doing and it could be solved match simpler,
but not just a few mental hoops simpler, a whole reverse the path in a binary tree simpler.
