All fired up, excited, interesting ideas flood your mind, you break open your laptop and start typing,
but by then you already made a <b>crucial mistake</b>. Do you wanna know why?

# The problem

I <b>f***ed</b> this up so many times, I feel confident and I jump in on
a task and start hammering out code, it works, it's tidy, it's smart, it does the job.
Then sometime later I realize, I solved the wrong problem ðŸ˜†

# Thinking before coding

Among other things, it can prevent you from contextualizing or modeling the problem wrong,
because usually, my problem is that I think I know the problem so I can start working out
the solution, but when it comes to more complex problems, it could be that you classify
the problem wrong and start solving it needlessly.

# Pen and paper

Try spending <b>15 minutes</b> with a <b>pen and paper before</b> you start coding, so maybe you can avoid
the painful realization after -*hopefully just a day but some unfortunate times a week*- of coding
that you solving the wrong problem.

but it will be always easier to solve a simpler problem, no matter
how good you are, your solution always will be more complicated if your
mental model of the problem is also are.
