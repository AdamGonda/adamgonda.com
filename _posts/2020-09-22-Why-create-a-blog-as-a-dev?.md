I though it would be nice to create a list with a few items to explain why I think that
is is a good idea to create a blog as a software developer.

# Learning by teaching
When you have to write about a topic, you have to understand it well enough so you can explain it in detail to others, so if you have holes in your knowledge you inevitably have to learn.

If I am presented with a problem I like to take it apart into the smallest pieces and first understand all of them from the ground up, then build my understanding from there.
So in case of my process of understanding, when I try to reconstruct the whole concept from the ground up I can clearly see if one piece is shaky in my knowledge so I can focus on that part then repeat it until eventually I master the whole subject.

The picture ‚ÜóÔ∏è is the **Learning Pyramid** which shows that there are passive and active ways to learn and how effective the knowledge acquisition is respectively, if you check out the bottom part where the learning process is the most effective, you can see that teaching is the best way to learn something. So it seems that writing a blog post with the right mindset is probably a nice way to acquire new knowledge.

# Stand out
Not everybody takes the trouble to invest into a blog. It is not easy so you have to be diligent and you have to really care about it. I think is is really shows if you really care about the job or not. I am not saying if you‚Äôre not doing it you are a terrible developer, I am just saying if you do it, it‚Äôs show your enthusiasm. 

# Showcase your knowledge
Finding the right job is not easy, you have to go through a lot of interviews during the process and you have to convince people that you know what you're talking about.
The last time I had to do this I felt that in an ideal situation if I apply somewhere the people who will decide if I am a good fit or not potentially benefit from some kind of an information pool where they can draw from to further investigate me.
I think in a form of a blog you can showcase your knowledge about technologies, dev methodologies etc.

# Organise your toughs
I don‚Äôt know if is just me but I very fequently find myself thinking about different concepts regarding software development. Probably because I am drawn to it and I like to think about them üòÑ
But I tend to forget stuff so if I create a post about something at least I can find it and also I can show it to others, like colleges, so they can check out what I think about the given subject. For example one time I liked to talk about CQRS. I read a lot of stuff about it that time but when I wanted to explain it to my college I struggled with it, it wold be so nice if I could just point them to my blog post so they could check it out.
