Mind control, visualization, positive thinking, meditation, mindfulness.
Overused terms, some mainstream some already corny.
But are they bullshit?
Or we just became lazy and bought the easily purchaseable happiness concept?

# Are we fucked?

There are useful facts about how our mind works. Like that we think in stories,
we stuck in this wierd word of a constant unfolding of time. We are like a needle on a record.
We ride this wave of mix of sensory inputs and random thoughts which are steer our attention
away.

If you ever tried meditation than you are familiar with the phenomena.
You are sitting in silence and examining your thoughts, as they come and go.
I wondered where thoughts come from, what is the mechanism, and the lowest
where I could go, to witness how they formed.
I find that it's seems to be a back box which spits these things out.
First I thought that this mechanism is random, but than I had to realize that I was wrong.
