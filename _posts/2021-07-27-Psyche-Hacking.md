Mind control, visualization, positive thinking, meditation, mindfulness.
Overused terms, some mainstream some already corny.
But are they bullshit?
Or we just became lazy and bought the easily purchaseable happiness lie?

# Needle on the track

There are useful facts about how our mind works. Like that we think in stories,
we stuck in this wierd word of the constant unfolding of time. We are like a needle on the track.
We ride this wave of mix of sensory inputs and random thoughts which are steer our attention.

If you ever tried meditation than you are familiar with the phenomena.
You are sitting in silence and examining your thoughts, as they come and go.
I wondered where thoughts come from, what is the mechanism, and the lowest
where I could go to witness how they formed.
I find that it's seems to be a back box that spits these things out.
First I thought that this mechanism is random, but than I had to realize that I was wrong.

# Modulate your black box

So when you realize that your mind is "programmable" which means you can tell it what kind of
thoughts you would it to spit out randomly, you have to realise a few other things as well,
or at least I did when I encountered this idea.

My first fear was that I will "create" these wrong thoughts
and cripple my life with the misusing of this powerful tool.

These thoughts come up way faster than you think and they play a crucial role
of how we interpret the world.
So it's important that we provide a good black box that will react positively,
creates good thoughts and eventually a good world.

# Be the good in the world

So I mentioned that you can control your life with this low level psyche hacking tool.
So the point is that this is a very simple system in regard of abstraction.
They kind a before speech, so you need to use simple terms, and messages that
need no conscious interpretation. Negation is non negotiable.

Negation has too much logic in it, it doesn't compute.
So need to avoid mantras and messages like: "I won't fail" and stuff like that.
The other thing is that you would like to define your present state,
so it's best to use present tense, this gives the best results.

But the most important for me was to be able to think good.
I was filled with fear. Where you stuck
in this vicious loop, when you fear that you will think bad stuff
and you are fucked.
