Mind control, visualization, positive thinking, meditation, mindfulness.
Overused terms, some mainstream some already corny.
But are they bullshit?
Or we just became lazy and bought the easily purchaseable happiness lie?

# Needle on the track

There are useful facts about how our mind works. Like that we think in stories,
we stuck in this wierd word of the constant unfolding of time. We are like a needle on the track.
We ride this wave of mix of sensory inputs and random thoughts which are steer our attention
away.

If you ever tried meditation than you are familiar with the phenomena.
You are sitting in silence and examining your thoughts, as they come and go.
I wondered where thoughts come from, what is the mechanism, and the lowest
where I could go, to witness how they formed.
I find that it's seems to be a back box which spits these things out.
First I thought that this mechanism is random, but than I had to realize that I was wrong.

# Modulate your black box

So when you realize that your mind is "programmable" which means you can tell it what kind of
thoughts you would it to spit out randomly, you have to realise a few other things as well,
or at least I did when I encountered this idea.

So first: My first fear was that if I can decide, what if I will do it wrong
and cripple my life with the misusing of this powerful tool.

Secund: These thoughts come up way faster than you think and they play a crucial role
of how we interpret the world, therefore how the world is around us.
So it's curtal that we provide a good base black box that will react positively.
