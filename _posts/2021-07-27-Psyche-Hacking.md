Mind control, visualization, positive thinking. Overused terms and they mostly mainstream.
But are they bullshit? Or we just been overfed with the message of the buyable happiness concept?
Greed and deception are popular tools on the belt.

# Are we fucked?

There are useful infos about how your mind works. Like that we think in stories,
we stuck in this wierd word, or realm of ours. We are like a needle on the record.
We ride this wave of a mix of sensory inputs and random thoughts which are steer our attention.

If you ever tried meditation than you are familiar with the phenomena.
I wondered where thoughts come from, what is the mechanism, and the lowest
where I could go. I find that it's seems to be a back box which spits these things out.

First I thought that this mechanism is random, but than I had to realize that I was wrong.

# It seems we have the power

We can modulate our thoughts that are thrown from the black box.
