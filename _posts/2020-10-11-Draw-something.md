It is just a fun little drawing

This post part of the series of FunMonth. I did draw this during the day into my notepad
but not with the intention to call it my "daily creation". But then I thought it would be
fun to create a vector graphic from if in Affinity Designer so here is the result.

{% include post-image.html
  title="Faces"
  src="faces.jpg"
  date=page.date
%}
