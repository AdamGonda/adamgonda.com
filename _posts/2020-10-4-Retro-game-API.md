Here comes some kind of short introduction

# First steps

It's one of my fun experimental projects. I like to create games and I
liked to learn more about [FP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming){:target="_blank"}
so I took my favorite game to implement [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)){:target="_blank"} and implemented it using
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript){:target="_blank"} in a functional manner.
When it was done I started to think about the [stateless](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application_development/9781788831437/1/ch01lvl1sec16/stateless-versus-stateful){:target="_blank"}
nature of FP and the beauty of this implementation. The business logic is nicely separated from everything
else, and the whole thing is a pure function. This implementation used [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/){:target="_blank"} and I rendered the game to the [console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_console){:target="_blank"}.

# Spice it up

The presentation and the game logic already was two different things.
The API between the two was very clear, so I started to think... 

One option is to ship the logic to the frontend, but it's too obvious
and this is my little fun project. So I though that it would be
interesting if this code stays at the backend.
The API is already very clear and my implementation is totally stateless
and separate from the presentation ðŸ¤ .

So I took the game logic and I created a Node app and I decided to host it on
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/){:target="_blank"}.

# Solution

**Backend**:
Node server running on Heroku, totally stateless and it knows nothing about the rendering.
It is just a mapping between:
``` js
(currentState, input) => newState
```

<br>

**Frontend**:
I called my old friend [p5.js](https://p5js.org){:target="_blank"}
to the rescue for the rendering. With the clean separation, this
module's job is very straightforward. It's initializes the state, then
it calls the Node server on every iteration of the game to get the new state to render.

# PS

Of course this is not an optimal solution, But I thought it maybe can
useful for learning proposes, for concepts like:

- [Network latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)){:target="_blank"}
- [Concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)){:target="_blank"}
- [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns){:target="_blank"}

<br>
<br>
So you can learn about them first hand without the need to implement
any business logic, and with games involved ðŸ˜€, which always makes
things more fun I think.

Ooo! after snake I was interested in what
other games can I implement this way, so I started to add more, check
them out.
