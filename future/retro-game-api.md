## Why, How it’s made

I started to play with FP as a concept and I wondered how an application can be built with it.
I think JavaScript is a good choice if you like to experiment with this paradigm.

I have this good habit regarding experimenting with new tech. I usually build something familiar with it first, something that I built before for a few times, in this case I went with the good old snake game in the terminal.

After I finished I had this fully FP styled snake game written using Node and JavaScript.
I could architect the code in a way that was new to me. As I said it wasn't the first time for me to implement this. But I did it in OOP before, and the result was vastly different in terms of implementation details.

I found that this approach was much better. It happened to be well organized and architected.
It seemed that this approach encapsulates all the best practices that I care about.
